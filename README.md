# Wind
Wind (Wind is not dummy) :)
A sub-150-loc X11 window manager, that works without any dumb dumb stuff.

# Features
 - Simple drag to move
 - Simple drag to resize
 - Wheel for all sides size increments/decrement
 - Cool outline style drag move

# Installation
Xlib is the only dependency
```
make 
make install
```

# Keymaps?
Nah, speration of WM and hotkey daemon give user a very clear seperation and more managable configuration. [Sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) is simple, and you don't have to deal with some dumb stuffs, just like Wind.
